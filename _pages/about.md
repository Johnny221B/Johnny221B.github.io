## About Me

Hi, this is Toby's homepage. I am a year 3 undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), majoring in **Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence Stream).**

I am deeply passionate about the field of deep learning and currently exploring technologies like **Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Large Language Models (LLM).** Additionally, I am experimenting with integrating LLM with graph to explore new possibilities.

I am always open to new learning opportunities and collaborations in the field of deep learning and related technologies. Feel free to reach out to me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/tobyyang7) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tobyyang7) profiles.
