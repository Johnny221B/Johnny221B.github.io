Hi, this is Toby's homepage. I am a year 3 undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), majoring in **Computer Science and Engineering.** My academic journey has been focused on a wide range of subjects including Data Structure, Operating System, Computer Architecture, and Machine Learning.

I am deeply passionate about the field of deep learning and am currently delving into **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLM).**

I am always open to new learning opportunities and collaborations in the field of deep learning and related technologies. Feel free to reach out to me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/tobyyang7) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tobyyang7) profiles.
