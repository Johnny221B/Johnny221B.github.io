abstract = {The issue of delay propagation prediction in airport networks has garnered increasing global attention, particularly due to its profound impact on operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction in modern air transportation systems. Despite research advancements in this domain, existing methodologies often fall short of comprehensively addressing the challenges associated with predicting delay propagation in airport networks, especially in terms of handling complex spatial-temporal dependencies and sequence couplings. In response to the complex challenge of predicting delay propagation in airport networks, we introduce the Fusion-based Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Learning with Coupled Attention (FAST-CA) framework. FAST-CA is an innovative model that integrates dynamic and adaptive graph learning, coupled attention mechanisms, periodicity feature extraction, and multifaceted information fusion modules. This holistic approach enables a thorough analysis of the interplay between flight departure and arrival delays and the spatial-temporal correlations within airport networks. Rigorously evaluated on two extensive real-world datasets, our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline models, showcasing superior predictive performance and the effective learning capabilities of its intricately designed modules. Our research highlights the criticality of analyzing spatial-temporal relationships and the dynamics of flight coupling, offering significant theoretical and practical contributions to the advancement and management of air transportation systems.},

      abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have advanced financial applications, yet they often lack sufficient financial knowledge and struggle with tasks involving multi-modal inputs like tables and time series data. To address these limitations, we introduce Open-FinLLMs, a series of Financial LLMs. We begin with FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a 52 billion token financial corpus, incorporating text, tables, and time-series data to embed comprehensive financial knowledge. FinLLaMA is then instruction fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions, resulting in FinLLaMA-instruct, which enhances task performance. Finally, we present FinLLaVA, a multimodal LLM trained with 1.43M image-text instructions to handle complex financial data types. Extensive evaluations demonstrate FinLLaMA's superior performance over LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and BloombergGPT in both zero-shot and few-shot settings across 19 and 4 datasets, respectively. FinLLaMA-instruct outperforms GPT-4 and other Financial LLMs on 15 datasets. FinLLaVA excels in understanding tables and charts across 4 multimodal tasks. Additionally, FinLLaMA achieves impressive Sharpe Ratios in trading simulations, highlighting its robust financial application capabilities. We will continually maintain and improve our models and benchmarks to support ongoing innovation in academia and industry.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Quant-GPT, a novel multi-agent optimized for Ashare market investment decisions. Leveraging a fine-tuning combination of
distilled sentiment analysis from ChatGPT and real-world market data, the
prediction agent of Quant-GPT addresses the challenges of model collapse
and weak causality between sentiment and expected returns. Our methodology integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent and summary agent, enabling the model to access relevant news articles and corporate announcements summary with concise investment information to enhance investment decision-making. The inclusion of diverse datasets and
RAG significantly improves the model’s ability to forecast market trends and
returns accurately. Experimental results demonstrate Quant-GPT’s superior performance over existing open-source LLMs in terms of annualized return, maximum draw-down, and Sharpe ratio. These findings underscore
the potential of advanced language models in financial applications, providing a robust framework for integrating natural language understanding
with quantitative investment strategies. The code is available on GitHub:

  abstract={Artificial light, while convenient, poses significant risks, including disruption of circadian rhythms in wildlife and severe health consequences for humans. California’s escalating light pollution problem exemplifies the need for effective solutions. To address this, we developed a light pollution risk assessment model focusing on economic, demographic, and ecological impacts, using indicators such as GDP per capita, population density, and the biological abundance index. The model, weighted by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), was tested in California’s diverse regions—protected areas, rural, suburban, and urban settings. Our findings suggest that interventions, particularly limiting light sources with specific wavelengths, can significantly reduce light pollution risk, especially in suburban areas, demonstrating a risk reduction of up to 2.63%. These results highlight the importance of targeted strategies in mitigating light pollution effectively.}
