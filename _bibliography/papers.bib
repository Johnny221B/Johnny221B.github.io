abstract = {The issue of delay propagation prediction in airport networks has garnered increasing global attention, particularly due to its profound impact on operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction in modern air transportation systems. Despite research advancements in this domain, existing methodologies often fall short of comprehensively addressing the challenges associated with predicting delay propagation in airport networks, especially in terms of handling complex spatial-temporal dependencies and sequence couplings. In response to the complex challenge of predicting delay propagation in airport networks, we introduce the Fusion-based Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Learning with Coupled Attention (FAST-CA) framework. FAST-CA is an innovative model that integrates dynamic and adaptive graph learning, coupled attention mechanisms, periodicity feature extraction, and multifaceted information fusion modules. This holistic approach enables a thorough analysis of the interplay between flight departure and arrival delays and the spatial-temporal correlations within airport networks. Rigorously evaluated on two extensive real-world datasets, our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline models, showcasing superior predictive performance and the effective learning capabilities of its intricately designed modules. Our research highlights the criticality of analyzing spatial-temporal relationships and the dynamics of flight coupling, offering significant theoretical and practical contributions to the advancement and management of air transportation systems.},

  note={A Large Language Model for A-share Market Investment},
  abstract={The core recipe of Quant-GPT is to leverage both distilled sentiment analysis data from ChatGPT and real-world announcements from the A shares market in the supervised finetuning stage. This is not only because purely using ChatGPTdistilled data might cause "model collapse" and the weak causality between sentiment and expected return, but also because real-world data from the A shares market reflects the common expectation of all the investors.

To synergize the strengths of finance news, we introduce RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) where a searching tool is designed to retrieve related news of company announcements, assisting Quant-GPT make more accurate judgments on the expected return of the announcement.}

  note={Predicting Purchase Intentions for Dynamic Insurance Pricing},
  abstract={In this project, we designed an AI system to identify
potential travel insurance intentions of customers. Our designed
large language model (LLM), named Insurance-GPT, is capable
of analyzing in real-time during interactions with users and it
utilizes deep learning model to accurately predict flight delay. This
provides a good user experience, as well as provides a reference
for pricing strategies to insurance companies. The Insurance-GPT
can be downloaded at https://modelscope.cn/models/TobyYang7/
InsuranceGPT. Additionally, the complete source code for this
project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/TobyYang7/
